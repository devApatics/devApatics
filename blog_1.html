                <p>
                    When examining some of the telehealth or telemedicine indictments a few common characteristics
                    scream off the page. Relationships
                    between dishonest doctors, pharmacies, labs and equipment or supplies providers are endemic in
                    almost
                    every case. In short, collusion between bad actors is part of each major fraud case.

                    Surfers talk a lot about sets, groups of waves that keep coming one behind the other. While that may
                    be a surfer’s dream,
                    the continuous cadence of telehealth fraud, waste and abuse stories is looking more like sets of
                    tsunamis
                    coming one after the other.

                    The dollar amounts of charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice for telehealth and
                    telemedicine fraud are staggering.
                    Indictments for $4.5 billion and $1.2 billion are just the tip of the iceberg in a telemedicine
                    market
                    that is growing by 26.5 percent per year and expected to reach $475 billion by 2026. It’s a big
                    market
                    with a big fraud, waste and abuse problem.

                        The other common characteristic is that it does not require very many fraudulent providers to do
                        a lot of damage. In a Florida
                        telehealth fraud case announced May 3, 2021, the Department of Justice charged only three men in
                        a $47 million healthcare fraud, kickback and money laundering scheme. In the $4.5 billion case
                        referenced
                        above, 86 providers were charged. And the $1.2 billion case involved only 24 people. Those are
                        all
                        very tightknit groups of providers united to engage in telehealth fraud.

            </h4>
            <p>
                Healthcare payers including government agencies, private insurers and self-funded employers are all
                asking the same question,
                “How can we detect bad actors BEFORE they have the opportunity to commit fraud?”. The answer lies in
                using
                advanced artificial intelligence technology to connect-the-dots between structured and unstructured data
                from related and unrelated sources.

                APATICS was recently awarded a core technology patent for our Halo AI™ data intelligence platform that
                powers a machine-learning
                model trained using representations of a set of resource requests and authorization determinations to
                identify
                and adjudicate behaviors and transactions that are representative, or predictive of operational threats.
                In simple language, our APATICS Provider Network Integrity & Performance Solution, powered by Halo AI™,
                can
                be used to identify problem providers, relationships and behaviors. Here is how it works.

                    APATICS Provider Network Integrity & Performance Solution, powered by Halo AI™ uses provider data,
                    payer data, public data and our own proprietary database of 6.7 million NPIs to immediately and
                    constantly detect problematic activity on any provider network. The immediate output is detection of
                    unauthorized providers, fraudulent providers operating under aliases, potentially fraudulent
                    providers and potential collusion and relationships that point to fraudulent intent. And, because
                    fraud and fraudulent providers are dynamic, APATICS Provider Network Integrity & Performance
                    Solution, powered by Halo AI™ provides continuous surveillance to detect changes in provider
                    demographics, status, behaviors and relationships that are indicators of new fraudulent behaviors.
