                        The fraud, waste and abuse cases and convictions being prosecuted by the Department of Justice
                        point to the rising sophistication
                        and negative impact a single provider, or small group of providers, can have on the healthcare
                        system.
                        This week’s conviction of a physician known as the ‘Fountain of Youth’ doctor is the latest
                        example
                        of fraudulent activity that is now detectable and preventable using APATICS’ patented Halo AI™
                        intelligence
                        platform based on machine and deep-learning. A Fox Chapel, PA cardiologist was sentenced to six
                        and
                        one-half years in prison on August 5 for his role in a fraud scheme involving more than $13
                        million
                        in false insurance claims, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.1 The fraudulent behavior
                        occurred
                        between 2008 and 2013 and included claims submitted to private health insurance companies as
                        well
                        as government insurance programs for an outpatient treatment called External Counter Pulsation.

                        The key is detecting anomalies in relationships, behaviors and outcomes in a way that
                        immediately and continuously reduces
                        risk. Automated machine-learning empowers 24/7 surveillance of financial and clinical claims
                        data
                        and interrogates each and every claim against millions of data points including ICD-10 codes,
                        CPT
                        codes, payer guidelines, collusion maps, patterns and relationships with other providers.
                        APATICS’
                        proprietary database of information on 6.7 million providers adds another powerful layer of
                        financial
                        and demographic sophistication to this surveillance. In doctor Shah’s case, the blatant
                        anomalies
                        in his claims would have been identified in near real-time using the Halo AI™ artificial

                <p>
                    FBI Special Agent in Charge, Robert Jones said, “Health care fraud is a serious problem that impacts
                    every American. It takes
                    critical resources from our health care system and increases health care costs for everyone.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    My work in both the Canadian and American healthcare systems showed me the extent to which care
                    quality and quantity are
                    compromised because of fraudulent actors. Our initial commercial deployment of the APATICS
                    <span class="font-italic">FWA Detection, Prevention & Recovery</span> solution, powered by Halo AI™
                    showed us that this fraud,
                    waste and abuse involves a range of one to 20 percent of providers depending on the network.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most fraudsters’ relationships, collusions and behaviors are generally the same, and they are
                    detectable. That is why I was
                    motivated to build the Halo AI™ artificial intelligence platform. Healthcare needs this type of tool
                    to fix what is estimated to be a $700 billion problem in the United States.
