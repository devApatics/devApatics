                            A 2021 APATICS analysis of over four (4) million workers compensation claims paid showed
                            that 19,612 providers out of a network
                            of 86,000 submitted fraudulent claims totaling about 10% of all claims paid during 2020.
                            This
                            study was conducted retrospectively using 2020 claims and network provider data for a
                            regional
                            workers compensation payer that paid about $107 million in fraudulent claims on
                            approximately
                            $1.17 billion in total payments.

                            The findings in this regional workers compensation study were similar to other analyses

                            (22.8%) of providers were flagged for some level of FWA activity. Twenty-two (22) providers
                            were

                            Numerous providers were practicing with multiple tax ID numbers and hundreds of others had

                        The second set of preventable FWA findings center around coding and other detectable and
                        preventable behavioral ‘red flag’
                        anomalies. Common findings included: 1) suspicious drug prescriptions with specific CPT codes,
                        2)
                        outlier procedures associated with a particular ICD code or provider type and 3) procedures
                        billed
                        outside of evidence-based guidelines. All of these FWA-related anomalies and more are detectable

                        claim
                        to be audited against millions of complex combinations of CPT and ICD-10 codes and payer

                <h5>Quickly Recover FWA Claims Paid </h5>
                <p>
                    APATICS FWA Detection, Prevention and Recovery Solution, in this analysis, proved to provide
                    unprecedented intelligence for
                    quantifying FWA activity by provider. Think of it as a complete FWA case file at the
                    press-of-a-button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This enables recovery efforts to begin quickly and equips collectors with deep provider-specific
                    data to align recovery efforts
                    as closely as possible with the action, creating the best possible scenario for collection.

                <h5>Make Targeted Changes To Mitigate Future FWA Risk </h5>
                <p>
                    This analysis demonstrated a number of macro-actions that the payer could take to mitigate future
                    FWA risk. These steps included:
                    1) extract rendering provider information from PDF images, 2) manage invalid or missing data
                    problems
                    by back-walking based on known attributes, 3) improving the plan design and 4) improving formulary
                    design.
                </p>
                <h5>Establish Real Time Detection & Prevention To Save Big Dollars </h5>
                <p>
                    The workers compensation payer study demonstrated that detecting and preventing FWA claims from
                    being paid, can literally
                    save payers millions of dollars each year in the costs of over-payment and collection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It also proved that the APATICS

                    <span class="font-italic">FWA Detection, Prevention & Recovery</span> solutions are powerful tools
                    in not only recovering FWA over-payments,
                    but also in detecting and preventing the cost, time, and manpower burden of recovering fraudulent
                    payments.
