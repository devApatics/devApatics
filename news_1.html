                            A 2021 APATICS analysis of over four (4) million workers compensation claims paid showed that 19,612 providers out of a network
                            of 86,000 submitted fraudulent claims totaling about 10% of all claims paid during 2020. This
                            study was conducted retrospectively using 2020 claims and network provider data for a regional
                            workers compensation payer that paid about $107 million in fraudulent claims on approximately
                            $1.17 billion in total payments.

                <p>
                    APATICS FWA Detection, Prevention and Recovery Solution, in this analysis, proved to provide unprecedented intelligence for
                    quantifying FWA activity by provider. Think of it as a complete FWA case file at the press-of-a-button.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This enables recovery efforts to begin quickly and equips collectors with deep provider-specific data to align recovery efforts
                    as closely as possible with the action, creating the best possible scenario for collection.

                <h5>Make Targeted Changes To Mitigate Future FWA Risk </h5>
                <p>
                    This analysis demonstrated a number of macro-actions that the payer could take to mitigate future FWA risk. These steps included:
                    1) extract rendering provider information from PDF images, 2) manage invalid or missing data problems
                    by back-walking based on known attributes, 3) improving the plan design and 4) improving formulary design.
                </p>
                <h5>Establish Real Time Detection & Prevention To Save Big Dollars </h5>
                <p>
                    The workers compensation payer study demonstrated that detecting and preventing FWA claims from being paid, can literally
                    save payers millions of dollars each year in the costs of over-payment and collection.
                </p>
