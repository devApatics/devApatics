                        claims
                        paid during 2020. This study was conducted retrospectively using 2020 claims and network

                        <p>
                            The workers compensation payer study demonstrated that detecting and preventing FWA claims from
                            being paid, can literally
                            save payers millions of dollars each year in the costs of over-payment and collection.

                            It also proved that the APATICS

                            but also in detecting and preventing the cost, time, and manpower burden of recovering fraudulent
                            payments.
